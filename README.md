# Angles-Demons

## Background:
1. There exists a normal chess board with two sides the White (Angels) and the Black (Demons).
1. The Angels' side contains 1 King only.
1. The Demons' side contains 2 Rooks, 2 Knights and 2 Bishops.

## Gameplay:
The aim for the Angel's King is to reach the other side of the board. This must be with normal King movements. The Demons' sides aim is to capture (Checkmate) the Angel's King. However, this was all then the game would truely be boring. The Angel side has a secret power, that is that wherever the King moves from a pawn is placed down on that square. These Angel side pawn are in complete control of the King, and can be moved like a normal pawn, but can also be completely remove from the chessboard without lossing a turn.
